    **Navigation**, and **ActionBar** sub components to disappears when scrolling down. The fix

## 6.4.6

- Removed **ActionBar's** magnification icon when in mobile view.

## 6.4.5

#### Bug Fix

## 6.4.4

#### Bug Fix
- Changed the way we import our css exported color variables into JS for some Jest research.

## 6.4.3

#### Bug Fix
- [PR #73](https://github.com/saddlebackdev/react-cm-ui/pull/73)
    - Fix up a few functions in **DateUtils** that were ported over from Healthy
    Church.  In particular, fix it so we do not introduce the "UNIX Epoch Bug",
    where a functions expecting a numeric timestamp would incorrectly return `null`
    upon encountering a value of zero, as opposed to 1 January 1970 as they should.
    This bug was patched in HC's corresponding **DateUtils** functions a while
    back, but was inadvertantly reintroduced to the React CM UI versions.

## 6.4.2

#### Bug Fix
- [PR #72](https://github.com/saddlebackdev/react-cm-ui/pull/72)
    - Fix possible dereference of `undefined` during **Page.TableRow** render.
    The logic trying to fetch the size of the cell was failing to take into
    that the size data for that cell might not be available yet.  This was
    happening in the Healthy Church client app when using the **PageTable** in
    combination with our "load more" / "infinite scroll" component.  So we added
    an additional safety check to prevent the error.

## 6.4.1

#### Bug Fix
- [PR #71](https://github.com/saddlebackdev/react-cm-ui/pull/71)
    - Fixed regression in certain nested **Drawer** scenarios caused by a default
    value of "top" for the new `positionY` prop. `positionY` prop should only be
    set to "top" or "bottom" if the new sticky drawer behavior is desired.
    It must default to not being set at all. Having it default to "top" was
    preventing the "nested toggles" in the page mobile filters drawer from being
    visible, due to `overflow: hidden;` in the CSS for the sticky drawer.

## 6.4.0

### Feature

    - Added ability to make **Drawer** component sticky and set `max-height` for those sticky drawers

    - Build Prompt functionality into **&lt;Page.ActionsBar /&gt;** (specifically
    the **&lt;ActionBarActionsButton /&gt;** for the mobile actions menu) so that
    various options or sub-options can request and configure a confirmation
    **Prompt** before their `onClick` action is actually fired.
- [PR #66](https://github.com/saddlebackdev/react-cm-ui/pull/66)
    - Additional updates to **Page.Details**
- [PR #67](https://github.com/saddlebackdev/react-cm-ui/pull/67)

#### Bug Fix
- Fixed our exported `dateUtils` class to not throw errors when using certain utility functions it has to offer.
- Added `dateUtils` functions not in react-cm-ui's class from HC's `dateUtils` file to sync up. HC is now supposed to be using react-cm-ui's `dateUtils` functions instead of the now deprecated HC `dateUtils` functions.
- **Button** only has one height now. No more `44px` for desktop.

#### Doc
- Split up the `./docs/src/elements/icon.js` file into two, `./docs/src/elements/iconSet.js` and `./docs/src/elements/iconExamples.js` and added routes to those specific pages. We can now link directly to the exact location.

## 6.1.1

#### Bug Fix
- Fix an issue in **&lt;DatePickerInput /&gt;** component when using two such
inputs to define the 'from' and 'to' dates for a date range.  When typing out
either 'from' date or 'to' date (versus using the calendar to select it) both
dates would be cleared due to incorrect logic in the `_onInputChange()` function.

## 6.2.0

- New **&lt;ActivityIndicator /&gt;** component! Whoopee!
- **&lt;Page /&gt;**
  - New Prop: `id`. This prop checks for a `string`.

  - New Prop: `borderInverse`. This prop checks for `bool`

- Upgraded react-reponsive dependency to `7.0.0`.
- Breaking change: updated how we implement our colors in SCSS and JS.
  - You can no longer use `$bkgd` to achieve a hex value from `colors.scss`. Instead, import the same way, and use the function `color(backgroundColor)`.
  - In JS, you can now use our `colors.scss` variables by importing the desired color variable. e.g. `import { backgroundColor } from 'colors.scss'`.

## 4.0.1

## 4.0.0

- Changed file structure to use Feature First (Pods).
  - Breaking change if you are linking to `style.css` or the individual `.css` files

## 3.0.2 - 2019-06-20
### Added
- Added a `size` prop to **&lt;Table /&gt;**.

## 3.0.1 - 2019-06-13

## 2.0.22 - 2019-05-31
### Fixed
- [#49](https://github.com/saddlebackdev/react-cm-ui/pull/49): Fixes initialization of **&lt;Card /&gt;** View.
- Fixed **&lt;Icon /&gt;** svg style.

## 2.0.21 - 2019-05-28
### Added

## 2.0.20 - 2019-05-20
### Added
- [#48](https://github.com/saddlebackdev/react-cm-ui/pull/48): **&lt;Button /&gt;** `outline` can have different colors now.

### Fixed
- [#45](https://github.com/saddlebackdev/react-cm-ui/pull/45): **&lt;Avatar /&gt;** (User Icon) Image Fixes/Enhancements
- [#46](https://github.com/saddlebackdev/react-cm-ui/pull/46): Fixes warnings on passing object as title for drawers.

## 2.0.19 - 2019-05-17
### Fixed
- Remove `isOpen` from the **&lt;Drawer /&gt;** & **&lt;Modal /&gt;** `componentWillUnmount`. Hoping this catches all
the different states the drawer can be in. One concern is it removing class names from body when another drawer is
to stay open. We'll need to watch for this problem in the future.

## 2.0.18 - 2019-05-16
### Fixed
- **&lt;Drawer /&gt;** & **&lt;Modal /&gt;** were not cleaning up after themselves when unmounting; they now do.

## 2.0.17 - 2019-05-14
### Fixed
- Whoops! Forgot to check my work and had the **&lt;Modal /&gt;** ZIndexes incorrect.

## 2.0.16 - 2019-05-14
### Fixed
- Fixed a **&lt;Modal /&gt;** bug.

## 2.0.15 - 2019-05-09
### Fixed
- Second attempt to fix the bug in **&lt;Drawer /&gt;** by ensuring the removal of the
`_onClickOutside` event listener.  Since the **&lt;Drawer /&gt;** is used with a
**&lt;Portal /&gt;**, it is not unmounted the way typical components in the regular DOM
tree are, so the prior attempt to remove the event listener on unmount (in
`2.0.14`) was unsuccessful.  Hopefully this version will fare better.

## 2.0.14 - 2019-05-08
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in **&lt;Drawer /&gt;** by ensuring we remove `_onClickOutside` event
listener on unmount).

## 2.0.13 - 2019-05-07
### Fixed
- CSS for `disabled` **<Dropdown.Item />** when using "dark theme" for the menu.
This was still making the text of the item white, instead of the "static" color
as is proper for a disabled item.

## 2.0.12 - 2019-05-07
### Added
- Ability to mark a **<Dropdown.Item />** as `disabled`.

## 2.0.11 - 2019-05-01
### Fixed
- Removed console logs in **&lt;Drawer /&gt;**.

## 2.0.10 - 2019-05-01

### Fixed
- Added another condition to look if **&lt;Drawer /&gt;** is open before trying to add a style.

## 2.0.4 - 2019-04-26
### Fixed
- Fixed a **<Drawer.Header />** bug.

## 2.0.3 - 2019-04-25
### Fixed
- Fixed **&lt;Banner /&gt;** bug after upgrading to React 16.8.6.

## 2.0.2 - 2019-04-25
### Fixed
- Fixed **&lt;DatePickerInput /&gt;** react-tether component.

## 2.0.1 - 2019-04-25
### Fixed
- Removed **&lt;MenuTree /&gt;**. It was unused and never an officially designed component.

## 2.0.0 - 2019-04-25
### Added
- Added a new **<Drawer.Wing />** color: `grey`.

## 1.20.1 - 2019-04-11
### Added
- **&lt;Card /&gt;** and **&lt;PhoneInput /&gt;** now accept IDs. This is the same change as `v1.19.6`.

## 1.20.0 - 2019-04-09
### Changed
- Upgraded react-dnd.
- Upgraded react-portal which caused some refactoring of our **&lt;Banner /&gt;**, **&lt;Drawer /&gt;**, and **&lt;Modal /&gt;** components.

## 1.19.6 - 2019-04-11
### Added
- **&lt;Card /&gt;** and **&lt;PhoneInput /&gt;** now accept IDs.

## 1.19.5 - 2019-04-09
### Added
- **&lt;Prompt /&gt;** now accepts an ID.

### Fixed
- **&lt;Radio /&gt;** does not allow a click to happen when disabled.

## 1.19.4 - 2019-04-04
### Added
- **&lt;DropdownItem /&gt;** and **&lt;Banner /&gt;** implements the `id` value passed to them now.

## 1.19.3 - 2019-04-04
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug when a selected **`<DatePickerInput />`** and  **`<DatePickerCalendar />`** day is on an day that has an event.

## 1.19.2 - 2019-04-01
### Fixed
- **`<DatePickerInput />`** and  **`<DatePickerCalendar />`** allow `null now`.
- The `onChange` event handler will not fire if **`<DatePickerInput />`** and  **`<DatePickerCalendar />`** is disabled.

## 1.19.1 - 2019-03-28
### Added
- `<DatePickerInput />` and `<DatePickerCalendar />` modules get a much needed - forgotten - `style` prop.

### Fixed
- Changed the `<Icon>` display property from `inline-block` to `inline-flex` to fix some alignment issues throughout HC.
- Removed the `<button>` wrapping caret icons in `<Input />`.

## 1.19.0 - 2019-03-28
### Deprecated
- `<DatePicker />` has been **deprecated**. Please use [DatePickerInput](http://cm-ui-docs.saddleback.com/modules/date-picker-input) or [DatePickerCalendar](http://cm-ui-docs.saddleback.com/modules/date-picker-input). `<DatePicker />` will be removed in the next major version of react-cm-ui.

### Added
- New `<DatePickerInput />` and `<DatePickerCalendar />` modules.

## 1.18.11 - 2019-03-20
### Fixed
- Rearranged the placement of where we render the **Dropdown** `id`.

### Added
- Added the prop `id` to **Accordion**.

## 1.18.10 - 2019-03-04
### Fixed
- Removed `componentDidUpdate` from **Input** to fix some state issues when using an `onChange` event handler. :)

## 1.18.9 - 2019-02-26
### Fixed
- Upgraded `lodash` dependency to fix a possible security vulnerability
identified by `npm audit`.

## 1.18.8 - 2019-02-26
### Fixed
- `1.18.6` inadvertently caused some browsers to show a gray background for the
**Input** type `number` spin box controls (up and down arrows), likely due to
user agent defaults for button elements.  This patch sets a transparent
background color for these.

## 1.18.7 - 2019-02-26
### Added
- Added `200` and `300` as font-weight options to the sans serif font.

## 1.18.6 - 2019-02-26
### Fixed
- Fixed **Input** type `number` controls. Changed icons to buttons to stop the
highlighting of elements around the **Input**. Also, when `min` and `max` are set
values are kept between the two when using the controls.

## 1.18.5 - 2019-02-22
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue with **DurationPicker** component; it was not initializing
its internal state properly when a `value` prop was specified, so it was not
showing the initial value until a re-render.

## 1.18.4 - 2019-02-20
### Fixed
- Fixed **DatePicker** value when the date value is cleared.

## 1.18.3 - 2019-02-11
### Added
- Added `phone-cell`, `phone-home`, and `phone-work` to the **Icon** set.

## 1.18.2 - 2019-02-01
### Added
- Added `bell-recurring` the **Icon** set.

## 1.18.1 - 2019-01-25
### Added
- Add `id` prop to **Button** and **Dropdown** components.

## 1.18.0 - 2019-01-23
### Added
- Added new **DurationPicker** component.
### Fixed
- Fixed some issues with **Input** with `disabled` prop set.  It was still
doing state changes and calling `onChange()` so it was not acting disabled, even
if it was visually styled to appear disabled.

## 1.17.9 - 2019-01-17
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in the **Accordion** component.  When using it in exclusive mode,
you were unable to pass the value `0` to the `selected` prop to default select
the first item.  This was due to standard JavaScript truthy/falsy silliness;
`0` is falsy so a naive check for whether the prop was specified resulted in
falling back on `-1` (nothing selected) as a default when `0` was the specified
value.  Converted this to use Lodash's `_.isNil()` function for a more precise
check, and life is good!

## 1.17.8 - 2019-01-10
### Added
- Add `multi` property to **Radio** component.  This allows multiple selections
(which is useful in combination with `pill` for certain desired UI elements; see
#35)

## 1.17.7 - 2018-12-21
### Fixed
- As a further update to **1.17.6**, ensure that click event propagation is stopped
when a disabled **Checkbox** is clicked.

## 1.17.6 - 2018-12-21
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in the **Checkbox** component.  It was calling `onChange` even when the
`disabled` prop was set to `true`.  The upshot of that is, when used as a controlled
component, disabled Checkboxes were not quite as disabled as we might have liked! =)

## 1.17.5 - 2018-12-14
### Changed
- Fixed time zone select placeholder text (and added ability to specify it via prop) in **TimePicker** component.

## 1.17.4 - 2018-11-29
### Changed
- Fixed `zoneMatchProp` prop in **TimePicker** component.

## 1.17.3 - 2018-11-28
### Added
- Added `selectionMatchProp` prop in **Dropdown** component.

## 1.17.2 - 2018-11-04
### Changed
- `Dropdown` `onClick()` that was added in `1.17.1` has been removed and replaced with `onOpen()` and `onClose()`.
- `Dropdown` documentation page samples with user avatar images refactored to use local image files as the sample avatar
service we were previously using does not support HTTPS.  This way we can avoid mixed content issue if the documentation
site is viewed over HTTPS.

## 1.17.1 - 2018-11-01
### Added
- Add `onClick()` event to `Dropdown`.  This will be called whenever menu is expanded/collapsed, passing a Boolean
argument to indicate whether the menu is open (true) or closed (false).

## 1.17.0 - 2018-10-31
### Added
- Ability to edit and delete comments via the **Comment** component.
- Ability to instruct **Dropdown** to collapse the menu on change imperatively using new `collapseMenuOnChange` Boolean
prop regardless of whether or not it's a controlled component and there is a `value` prop change.
- Ability to set the title/tooltip for the **Icon** embedded within the **Dropdown** (via new `iconTitle` prop).
- Ability to set **Dropdown** color to `transparent`.
### Changed
- Bug fix in logic within **Dropdown** to update selected value state and collapse the menu on prop change.  Also converted
this from legacy `componentWillReceiveProps()` to proper `componentDidUpdate()`.
- Set some reasonable default behavior around **Icon** tooltip within the **Dropdown** (utilizing `placeholder` and/or `text`)
props when new `iconTitle` prop is not specified.
- Numerous enhancements to the documentation pages for **Dropdown** and **Prompt** components, including an example of
how to wrap a **Dropdown** with a **Prompt** but only have some options trigger the prompt but not others.  Also corrected
some typos and such.

## 1.16.3 - 2018-10-24
### Changed
- Nothing new; same as described in  **1.16.2**.  Due to some git user errors made by Geoffrey, `1.16.2` didn't contain the changes it
was supposed to.  And `npm` does not allow re-publishing the same version (see [here](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/77758351673/no-more-npm-publish-f)).  So I'm going to publish the corrected package as
`1.16.3` and remove `1.16.2`.  Sorry about that.

## 1.16.2 - 2018-10-24
### Changed
- **Image** component was updated to improve behavior in `avatar` mode.  Previously, if a consumer specified both `name`
and `src` props, the component would happily render _both_ the image _and_ the initials.  :man_facepalming:  That meant
that it was up to consumers to conditionally pass a `name` prop or not.  Now, the component itself has been fixed to do
the right thing.
- Also, the documentation page for the **Image** component should now correctly render the sample image.

## 1.16.1 - 2018-10-10
### Changed
- **Drawer** dimmers bug fix.

## 1.16.0 - 2018-09-25
### Added
- Added `showSpinners` prop in **Input** component.  When the `type` is "number" this new prop dictates whether or not
to show the "spin box" up and down arrow controls.  The new prop, which is optional, defaults to `true` and the spin box
controls are shown.  Set it to `false` to suppress these if you want a numeric input without them.

## 1.15.0 - 2018-09-21
### Added
- Added a CSS rule `.color-highlight`.

## 1.14.0 - 2018-09-18
### Changed
- Fixed a bug in **Dropdown** when passing a null child.

## 1.13.24 - 2018-09-18
### Changed
- **PhoneInput** Fixed bug affecting U.S. phone numbers specified without leading `+1` and with area codes with `1` in
the middle, e.g. 213, 714, etc.  These phone numbers were being mishandled.

## 1.13.23 - 2018-09-18
### Added
- **InfoBar** `color` goes to 11.

### Changed

## 1.13.8 - 2018-08-24

## 1.11.16 - 2018-07-16
